<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
Download and Install from link above.
<br>
Open Git Bash.
<br>

1. Initially, we will clone the github repo (folder). Navigate to your desktop (folder) in the shell and clone (copy from download). (cd - change directory to 'Desktop') (clone - download repo (folder)) </br>
`$ cd Desktop` </br>
`$ git clone https://github.com/brandon-rowe/github.git` `<-- input your repo here`</br>

2. Next we will navigate to the github repo. (cd - change directory to 'github' repo (folder))</br>
`$ cd github`</br>

3. Now that we have navigated to the repo (folder), we need to make sure our 
git credentials are entered. </br>
`$ git config --global user.name git_username` </br>
`$ git config --global user.email git_emailaddress` </br>

4. Once we have made our changes to the files within our github repo, we add
the changes from our working directory to the index (staging). </br>
`$ git add *` or `$ git add filename.txt filename.java` or `$git add .` </br>

5. Now we commit the changes from the index to the head (commiting). </br>
`$ git commit -m "some message about changes"` </br>

6. Lastly, we push the changes to the repo branch, usually the "dev" branch. </br>
`$ git push origin dev` </br>
